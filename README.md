# Gender Inequality Statistics
I have always been curious about the gender inequality present around the world, as a result I utilized the learnings of my Introduction to R class to showcase gender differences in the fields on education and employment. To do the same I analyzed a World Bank Dataset with data of 250+ countries to produce interactive visualizations using R, eventually deploying the web application using the Shiny App Platform.

Technologies Used : R, R libraries(dplyr, plotly, ggplot, shiny), Git
